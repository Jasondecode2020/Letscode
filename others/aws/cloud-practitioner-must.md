4. Which of the following is CORRECT regarding removing an AWS account from AWS Organizations?

The AWS account must be able to operate as a standalone account. Only then it can be removed from AWS organizations

5. A research group wants to use EC2 instances to run a scientific computation application that has a fault tolerant architecture. The application needs high-performance hardware disks that provide fast I/O performance. As a Cloud Practitioner, which of the following storage options would you recommend as the MOST cost-effective solution?

Instance Store

An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. This is a good option when you need storage with very low latency, but you don't need the data to persist when the instance terminates or you can take advantage of fault-tolerant architectures. For this use-case, the computation application itself has a fault tolerant architecture, so it can automatically handle any failures of Instance Store volumes.

As the Instance Store volumes are included as part of the instance's usage cost, therefore this is the correct option.
