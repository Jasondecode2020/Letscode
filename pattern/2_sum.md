- For problems involving two variables, such as the "two sum" problem , you can enumerate the right-hand side variable 
and convert it into a single-variable problem. This can be efficiently maintained using a hash table. For a + b = target, we want to find 2 numbers, we can enumerate right b, maintain left a by using a hash table.
