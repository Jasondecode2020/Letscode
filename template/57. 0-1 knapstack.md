### 2915. Length of the Longest Subsequence That Sums to Target

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        f = [0] + [-inf] * target # first number to be 0
        for x in nums:
            for i in range(target, x - 1, -1): # start from target to x, can't choose duplicate
                f[i] = max(f[i], f[i - x] + 1) # try to find max
        return f[-1] if f[-1] > 0 else -1
