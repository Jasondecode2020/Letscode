## template 1: recursion

```python
def fn(g): # g: graph
    def dfs(node):
        res = 0
        # some code
        for neighbor in g[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                ans += dfs(neighbor)
        return res

    visited = {START_NODE}
    return dfs(START_NODE)
```

### template 2: iteration

```python
def fn(g): # g: graph
    stack = [START_NODE]
    visited = {START_NODE}
    res = 0
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        # some code
        for neighbor in g[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                stack.append(neighbor)
    
    return res
```
